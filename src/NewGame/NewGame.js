        You have 1 minute to guess as many hate-symbols as you can. Each correct
        answer will take you straight to the next card, while incorrect answers

        Clicking the ðŸ’¾ will save that card in your Study Hall list to view
        later.

        Clicking ðŸ”„ at any time will flip the card to see the information or
        image.

        Many of the symbols are unsubtle and can be guessed easily. In these
        cases I encourage you to flip an unfamiliar card to read about the
        symbol's origins.

        to fascistic symbology and recognize it in the world.
